![Build & Test workflow](https://github.com/Jacques-Philippe/ts-template/actions/workflows/test-and-build.yml/badge.svg)

# Purpose

This project serves as a template for some typescript project. Use it to build on. :)

# How prettier was configured

See [the following readme](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/lint-staged)

# How the executable was made

We use [yarn package pkg](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/pkg) in tandem with @vercel/ncc to create executables from our nodejs project.
